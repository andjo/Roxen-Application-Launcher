Roxen Application Launcher for Linux (GNOME)
================================================================================

For those fortunate enough working with Roxen CMS, Roxen Application Launcher
lets you edit files on a remote Roxen CMS server in your preferred desktop
application.

This Roxen Application Launcher is primarily for the GNOME desktop and is
written in the programming language Vala which isn't needed per se if this is
the distribution package which will build from the C sources that was 
generated by the Vala compiler.


Getting started
================================================================================

To build run:

  name@machine:~$ ./configure
  name@machine:~$ make
  name@machine:~$ make install


Requirements (RAL 0.4.1)
================================================================================

	GLib        2.22.2    libglib
	GTK         2.18.3    libgtk2.0
	Gee         0.5       libgee      (Download from http://live.gnome.org/Libgee)
	Unique      1.1.2     libunique
	SOUP				2.28.1    libsoup2.4
	GCONF				2.28.0    libgconf2
	GIO					2.22.2    libgio
	GDK         2.18.3
	GNOME       2.28.0    libgnome
	GDK Pixbuf  2.18.3

I can't say these versions actually is required, they are the versions I have
built against and that's a standard Ubuntu 9.10 except for `libgee` which is
older in the Ubuntu repositories. (I think GIO, GDK and GDK Pixbuf is part of
GLib and GTK)


Build from Vala sources
================================================================================

If you build from the Vala sources Vala 0.7.7 is required. Before running
`./autogen.sh` you need to export the variable `RL_WITH_VALA` like

  name@machine:~$ export RL_WITH_VALA=true
	
or run 

  name@machine:~$ ./conf-with-vala

if you have downloaded the development branch.
